Lab2: File Sharing Platform

run server using "python lab2_server.py" and client using "python lab2_client.py"
server should then take care of itself and client usage should be mostly self-explanatory

Assumed running on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)

Note: no exit command for server, exit using Ctrl+C (theoretically an always-on server doesn't need an 'exit' anyway)

Note: used Professor Ogle's "sample_server.py" and "sample_client.py" as skeletons for my code

Note: the file list won't display
